A Transformer-based model for image classification, Vision Transformer (ViT) divides images into fixed-size patches, processes them as sequences, and uses self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies. ViT achieves impressive performance on image classification tasks, competing with traditional CNNs.
Features:

    1.Transformer architecture for image classification.

    2.State-of-the-art performance, especially on large datasets like ImageNet.
